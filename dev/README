# Cookbook Flaskpocket Dev Tool

Executes curl commands so you don't have to manage such long and awkward commands

Some commands require you to export a few environmental variables (IDENTITY, PASSWORD, TOKEN, USERID, or RECORDID) before running it.  Check the `Makefile` for hints about which variables are required for which commands.

`make` commands that start with a `p` interact directly with the pocketbase layer.  Non-`p` commands interact with the Flask layer

A non-exhaustive list of `make` commands (check the `Makefile` for definitive list)
```
make plogin
made padd
make pedit
make pview
make plist
make pdelete
